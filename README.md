## Notes
* You can change widget size with scroll wheel.
* You can change the display name of weekday and month by the translate function.
* In order to make those shortcuts work, you need to change the paths in the `Bluesh\Links\Links.ini` file. (default path is D:\\[folder name])
* The second dots are displayed in binary-coded sexagesimal, the leftmost bit is the most significant one.
